# Peer-to-Peer


* Bitcoin is structured as a peer-to-peer network architecture on top of the internet
* The network nodes interconnect in a mesh network with a "flat" topology. There is no server, no centralized service, and no hierarchy within the network



## Stratum

*  In addition to the bitcoin P2P protocol, there are other protocols
* Stratum that are used for mining and lightweight or mobile wallets
* additional protocols are provided by gateway routing servers that access the Bitcoin network using the bitcoin P2P protocol and then extend that network to nodes running other protocols
* Stratum servers connect Stratum mining nodes via the Stratum protocol to the main Bitcoin network and bridge the Stratum protocol to the bitcoin P2P protocol. 



## node types
* wallet, miner, full blockchain database, and network routing.
