# 51% attack

* "51% attack" - a group of miners, controlling a majority (51%) of the total networkâ€™s hashing power, collude to attack bitcoin.
* With the ability to mine the majority of the blocks, the attacking miners can cause deliberate "forks" in the blockchain and double-spend transactions or execute denial-of-service attacks against specific transactions or addresses.
