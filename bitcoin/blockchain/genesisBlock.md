# Genesis Block
* It is the common ancestor of all the blocks in the blockchain
* the genesis block is statically encoded within the Bitcoin client software, such that it cannot be altered
	* [see the code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3955c3940eff83518c186facfec6f50545b5aab5/src/chainparams.cpp#L147)
* every node has the starting point for the blockchain, a secure "root" from which to build a trusted blockchain.
