# Structure of a Block


```
4 bytes			Block Size		The size of the block, in bytes, following this field
80 bytes		Block Header		Several fields form the block header
1â€“9 bytes (VarInt)	Transaction Counter 	How many transactions follow
Variable		Transactions		The transactions recorded in this block
```

## Block Header

* three sets of block metadata:

```
(1) a reference to a previous block hash, which connects this block to the previous block in the blockchain
(2) difficulty, timestamp, and nonce, relate to the mining competition
(3) merkle tree root, a data structure used to efficiently summarize all the transactions in the block
```

* The structure of the block header 

```
|  4 bytes | Version | A version number to track software/protocol upgrades
| 32 bytes | Previous Block Hash | A reference to the hash of the previous (parent) block in the chain
| 32 bytes | Merkle Root | A hash of the root of the merkle tree of this block's transactions
|  4 bytes | Timestamp | The approximate creation time of this block (in seconds elapsed since Unix Epoch)
|  4 bytes | Difficulty Target | The Proof-of-Work algorithm difficulty target for this block
|  4 bytes | Nonce | A counter used for the Proof-of-Work algorithm

```
