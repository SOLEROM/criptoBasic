# about

* Ethereum is a deterministic but practically unbounded state machine, consisting of a globally accessible singleton state and a virtual machine that applies changes to that state.
* Ethereum is an open source, globally decentralized computing infrastructure that executes programs called smart contracts. 
* It uses a blockchain to synchronize and store the systemâ€™s state changes, along with a cryptocurrency called ether to meter and constrain execution resource costs.
