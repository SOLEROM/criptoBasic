## EOA
* EOA - Externally owned accounts are those that have a private key; having the private key means control over access to funds or contracts 
* Only EOAs can initiate transactions

## contract account
* contract account has smart contract code, which a simple EOA canâ€™t have
* contract account does not have a private key. Instead, it is owned (and controlled) by the logic of its smart contract code
* Contracts have addresses, just like EOAs
* Contracts can also send and receive ether, just like EOAs
* because a contract account does not have a private key, it cannot initiate a transaction
* contracts can react to transactions by calling other contracts
